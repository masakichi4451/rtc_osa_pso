  abstract={In distributed processing for communication services, a proper server selection scheme is required to reduce delay by ensuring the event occurrence order. Although a conservative synchronization algorithm (CSA) has been used to achieve this goal, an optimistic synchronization algorithm (OSA) can be feasible for synchronizing distributed systems. In comparison with CSA, which reproduces events in occurrence order before processing applications, OSA can be feasible to realize low delay communication as the processing events arrive sequentially. This paper proposes an optimal server selection scheme that uses OSA for distributed processing systems to minimize end-to-end delay under the condition that maximum status holding time is limited. In other words, the end-to-end delay is minimized based on the allowed rollback time, which is given according to the application designing aspects and availability of computing resources. Numerical results indicate that the proposed scheme reduces the delay compared to the conventional scheme.},

However, what if an application naturally calls for dependent rounding on the one hand and desires positive correlation on the other? More generally, we develop algorithms that guarantee the known properties of dependent rounding but also have nearly bestpossible behavior—near-independence, which generalizes positive correlation—on “small” subsets of the variables. The recent breakthrough of Li and Svensson for the classical k-median problem has to handle positive correlation in certain dependent rounding settings, and does so implicitly. We improve upon Li-Svensson’s approximation ratio for k-median from 2.732 + ϵ to 2.675 + ϵ by developing an algorithm that improves upon various aspects of their work. Our dependent rounding approach helps us improve the dependence of the runtime on the parameter ϵ from Li-Svensson’s NO(1/ϵ2) to NO((1/ϵ)log(1/ϵ)).},

Furthermore, some case studies illustrating real-world applications of HLPs are briefly introduced. At the end, future research directions and trends will be presented.}

  In this paper, the single facility minimax hub location problem is considered. The problem involves siting a hub facility in order to minimize the most costly interaction between a set of fixed nodes. Several solution techniques are reviewed, including: discrete locational evaluation; Helly's Theorem; a graphical approach; linear programming feasibility; and Drezner's round trip location algorithm. A comparison of these approaches favors the Drezner algorithm. The minimax hub location problem and the Drezner solution strategy are illustrated through application to air passenger flows between U.S. Cities.}

  abstract={This paper proposes two algorithms, namely Server-User Matching (SUM) algorithm and Extended Server-User Matching (ESUM) algorithm, for the distributed server allocation problem. The server allocation problem is to determine the matching between servers and users to minimize the maximum delay, which is the maximum time to complete user synchronization. We analyze the computational time complexity. We prove that the SUM algorithm obtains the optimal solutions in polynomial time for the special case that all server-server delay values are the same and constant. We provide the upper and lower bounds when the SUM algorithm is applied to the general server allocation problem. We show that the ESUM algorithm is a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm that can attain the optimal solution for the server allocation problem parameterized by the number of servers. Numerical results show that the computation time of ESUM follows the analyzed complexity while the ESUM algorithm outperforms the approach of integer linear programming solved by our examined solver.},

  abstract={This paper proposes a migration model for distributed server allocation. In distributed server allocation, each user is assigned to a server to minimize the communication delay. In the conventional model, a user cannot migrate to another server to avoid instability. We develop a model where each user can migrate to another server while receiving services. We formulate the proposed model as an integer linear programming problem. We prove that the considered problem is NP-complete. We introduce a heuristic algorithm. Numerical result shows that the proposed model reduces the average communication delay by 59% compared to the conventional model at most.},
